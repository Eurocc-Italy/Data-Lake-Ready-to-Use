# The Data Lake just a click away
Data Lake Ready to Use is a data storage and processing application based on the “data lake” model, which EuroCC **provides free of charge to small and medium-sized enterprises.**

## What is a Data Lake
A data lake is a storage system that allows raw data of different formats to be collected and processed in an unstructured manner. With its ability to handle large volumes of information, it **allows data from a variety of sources to be stored and accessed, making it available for future analysis**, modeling, or data-driven decision-making.

## There is no AI without Data Lake
**The Data Lake is essential for the development of AI-powered projects** because it provides a flexible and scalable platform to store large amounts of raw data. Machine learning algorithms need access to this data to recognize hidden patterns and create predictive models. Without the ability to handle heterogeneous and unstructured data, AI could not evolve efficiently.

## A valuable tool for companies
For a company, the Data Lake represents a competitive advantage because it allows you to centralize all data in one place, facilitating access and analysis.
Its ability to scale easily allows you to handle growing volumes of data without the need for complex restructuring. It also improves operational efficiency, enabling rapid analysis on which to base more informed decisions.

## How does our Ready to Use Data Lake work?
The EuroCC Data Lake can be customized and configured freely according to the company’s needs, and it integrates with supercomputing systems natively.

Optimal requirements to make the most of this technology:

 - Access to a cloud platform that uses OpenStack infrastructure, capable of providing the availability of a virtual machine with at least 8 vCPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage;
 - Access to an HPC system whose storage is configured in dual S3/parallel filesystem mode, with a budget valid for both storage resources and computing resources.

If these infrastructures are not already owned by the company, there is the possibility to request them through a European call for proposals, fully funded by public funds.

The deployment of the service has been simplified and automated to ensure the correct and complete functioning of the entire Data Lake infrastructure by following a few simple steps. To perform the installation, only a single computer with internet access to the cloud platform and the HPC system is required. Subsequently, it will be possible to interact with the Data Lake from any authorized computer. User and device authentication is performed via tokens and is solely and directly controlled by the company. It is also possible to limit access to the service to devices that are part of the corporate network only, thus minimizing the risk of cyber attacks.

The user manual, containing all the necessary steps, is available at [this link](Data_Lake_Ready_To_Use_V1.2.pdf).
